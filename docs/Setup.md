# Setup: build your calendar in 10 minutes

This page walks you from `npm install` to a working calendar that knows your team, saves to your database, and (optionally) syncs with Google or Microsoft 365. No prior React-calendar experience required.

Work through it top to bottom. Every step is optional after Step 1 — pick only the pieces you need.

> **Rule of thumb:** if a step doesn't match what you want, skip it. The calendar will still work.

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install works-calendar
```

Need React? If you don't already have a React app, the fastest way to start is:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-calendar -- --template react
cd my-calendar
npm install
npm install works-calendar
```

## 2. Put a calendar on the page

Paste this into `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
import { WorksCalendar } from 'works-calendar';
import 'works-calendar/styles';

export default function App() {
  return <WorksCalendar />;
}
```

Run `npm run dev`. You should see an empty calendar. That's your foundation — everything after this is adding powers to it.

## 3. Pick where your events live

This is the biggest decision. Use the table to pick one — you can change later.

| You want… | Pick | Hard? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Just play around on my own computer | **LocalStorage** | ⭐ easy |
| My own database (Postgres, MySQL, Mongo…) | **Custom adapter** | ⭐⭐ medium |
| A free hosted database without a backend | **Supabase** | ⭐⭐ medium |
| Sync with my Google Calendar | **Google Calendar** | ⭐⭐⭐ OAuth setup |
| Sync with my Outlook / Microsoft 365 | **Microsoft 365** | ⭐⭐⭐ OAuth setup |
| Read-only feed from an iCal / .ics URL | **iCal adapter** | ⭐ easy |
| Import/export spreadsheets | **Excel adapter** | ⭐ easy |

### 3a. LocalStorage (easiest)

Events save in the browser. No backend. Great for prototypes and single-user tools.

```jsx
import { WorksCalendar, createLocalStorageDataAdapter } from 'works-calendar';
import 'works-calendar/styles';

const adapter = createLocalStorageDataAdapter({ key: 'my-calendar' });

export default function App() {
  return <WorksCalendar adapter={adapter} />;
}
```

### 3b. Your own database

Pass an `events` array you loaded however you like, and an `onEventSave` that writes back.

```jsx
const [events, setEvents] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/events').then((r) => r.json()).then(setEvents);
}, []);

async function handleSave(event) {
  const saved = await fetch('/api/events', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(event),
  }).then((r) => r.json());
  setEvents((prev) => upsert(prev, saved));
}

<WorksCalendar events={events} onEventSave={handleSave} />
```

Your API decides the database. Postgres, MySQL, Mongo, Firebase — anything that speaks HTTP works.

### 3c. Supabase (free hosted DB, no backend required)

1. Create a project at https://supabase.com.
2. Create an `events` table with columns: `id`, `title`, `start`, `end`, `metadata` (jsonb).
3. Install the client: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`.
4. Use the Supabase adapter — see `src/api/v1/adapters/SupabaseAdapter.ts` for the wiring pattern.

### 3d. Sync with your company's email / calendar provider

Your work calendar almost certainly lives inside your company email account. Pick the one that matches your work email address:

| Your work email ends in… | Your provider is | Follow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@gmail.com` or a Google Workspace domain | Google Workspace | [Google Calendar setup](./GoogleCalendarSetup.md) |
| `@outlook.com`, `@hotmail.com`, or any Microsoft 365 domain | Microsoft 365 / Outlook | [Microsoft 365 setup](./Microsoft365Setup.md) |
| Something else (Zoho, FastMail, Proton…) | Use their iCal feed | [Section 3e](#3e-ical--ics-feed-read-only) |

Each provider guide is ~20 minutes the first time: register an app, pick a scope, paste two env vars. Once connected, events you create in WorksCalendar appear in Gmail / Outlook / every synced phone automatically, and vice-versa.

### 3e. iCal / .ics feed (read-only)

Perfect for pulling in a school calendar, sports schedule, or public holidays.

```jsx
import { ICSAdapter } from 'works-calendar/api/v1/adapters/ICSAdapter';
const adapter = new ICSAdapter({ url: 'https://example.com/holidays.ics' });
```

### 3f. Excel import/export

Install the optional dep:

```bash
npm install xlsx
```

Then use the export helpers in `src/export/excelExport.js` to dump events or hand your users an Upload button.

## 4. Pick which views to show

Views are the buttons across the top (Month, Week, etc.). Turn on only what you need.

```jsx
<WorksCalendar
  initialView="week"
  enabledViews={['month', 'week', 'day', 'agenda', 'schedule', 'timeline']}
/>
```

| View | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| `month` | Big picture, "is anything happening next week?" |
| `week` | Classic Google-Calendar weekly grid |
| `day` | Single-day, hour-by-hour |
| `agenda` | List view — great on phones |
| `schedule` | Team shifts / coverage (PTO → uncovered → filled) |
| `timeline` | Rows of resources across time (Gantt-like) |
| `assets` | Fleet / room / equipment rows (see Step 7) |

## 5. Add your team (optional)

If events belong to people, give the calendar a list of employees:

```jsx
const employees = [
  { id: 'e1', name: 'Alex Rivera', role: 'Nurse', color: '#3b82f6' },
  { id: 'e2', name: 'Sam Kim', role: 'Nurse', color: '#10b981' },
];

<WorksCalendar employees={employees} events={events} />
```

Each event's `employeeId` links it to a person. Colors, filters, and grouping all light up once employees exist.

## 6. Turn on team scheduling (optional)

This is WorksCalendar's headline feature: PTO automatically turns into open shifts, and open shifts turn into double-sided coverage events.

Switch the view on:

```jsx
<WorksCalendar
  employees={employees}
  events={events}
  initialView="schedule"
  onEventSave={handleSave}
/>
```

### The flow in plain English

1. **Alex has a shift.** Tuesday, 9 AM–5 PM. One event, assigned to Alex.
2. **Alex requests PTO.** In the timeline, click Alex's row → **Request PTO**. The calendar scans every shift Alex owns and looks for any that overlap the PTO window.
3. **Any overlapping shift becomes uncovered.** For each conflict, the calendar automatically creates an **open-shift** event (amber, unassigned, labelled `Open: <original shift>`). The original shift is marked covered so it doesn't keep regenerating.
4. **Someone picks up the open shift.** The scheduler (or the owner, or anyone with an assigned saved view of "open shifts") drags an employee onto the open shift — or uses the Cover action card.
5. **The calendar creates two mirrored events.** The original shift stays (now marked covered). The coverer gets a new shift of kind `covering` pointing back to the source. Both people see their own version; payroll/reporting can tell the difference.

Reverse the flow by deleting the PTO (everything folds back) or by revoking coverage.

### The four event kinds in the schedule

These are in `src/core/scheduleModel.js` — you don't write them by hand, but understanding them helps when you look at your data:

| Kind | Who has it | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shift` | Normal employee | A regular assigned shift |
| `on-call` | Normal employee | An on-call window (treated like a shift for conflicts) |
| `open-shift` | Nobody (amber) | Needs coverage — auto-created when PTO eats a shift |
| `covering` | The coverer | The mirror event when someone picks up an open shift |

### What the owner has to provide

The only thing you have to wire up is save. The calendar emits normal event operations; you persist them:

```jsx
async function handleSave(event) {
  // This same handler receives:
  //  - a new PTO event
  //  - an auto-generated open-shift event (meta.kind === 'open-shift')
  //  - a new covering event when someone covers
  //  - a mutation to the original shift flagging it covered
  await saveToYourBackend(event);
}
```

Nothing special is required to "turn on" the auto-open-shift logic — it fires whenever a PTO or Unavailable event is saved against an employee who has overlapping shifts.

### What users see

- **Employee on PTO:** their row shows a PTO block. Their original shifts look "covered" (muted).
- **The open shift:** an amber unassigned event sitting on the date that needs a warm body. Click it to see who was originally on.
- **The coverer:** their row shows the mirrored shift. Title prefixed `Covering: …` so it's obvious on their schedule.
- **Everyone else:** no visual change.

### "Auto-covered-by" — the truth about the "auto" part

The calendar **auto-detects** uncovered shifts. It does **not** auto-assign a coverer — a human clicks. If you want fully automatic assignment ("the next available employee gets it"), wire it in your save handler:

```jsx
async function handleSave(event) {
  if (event.meta?.kind === 'open-shift' && event.meta.status === 'open') {
    const candidate = pickNextAvailable(employees, event, allEvents);
    if (candidate) {
      return saveToYourBackend(assignCoverer(event, candidate));
    }
  }
  return saveToYourBackend(event);
}
```

`pickNextAvailable` is yours to write (fair rotation, seniority, lowest hours this week — whatever your team needs). Leaving it out is the common choice: most teams want a human to make that call.

### Common patterns

| You want… | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| A "needs coverage" queue | Saved view with filter `meta.kind == 'open-shift' AND meta.status == 'open'` |
| Only supervisors can cover | Gate the Cover action in your save handler by `user.role` |
| Require confirmation from the coverer | Pair this with the [approvals workflow](#75-turn-on-propose--review--approve--deny-for-assets-optional) on `covering` events |
| Fair rotation | Implement `pickNextAvailable` with a rolling index per team |
| Block coverers with their own conflict | Call `detectShiftConflicts` from `src/core/scheduleOverlap.js` before saving |

Full walkthrough: [Schedule workflow guide](./ScheduleWorkflow.md).

## 7. Track things, not just people (optional)

If you schedule rooms, vehicles, tools, or any non-human resource, pass them as `assets`:

```jsx
const assets = [
  { id: 'truck-1', name: 'Truck 1', type: 'vehicle' },
  { id: 'room-a', name: 'Conference A', type: 'room' },
];

<WorksCalendar assets={assets} initialView="assets" />
```

Assets get their own row in timeline and assets views, with horizontal virtualization so dozens of rows stay snappy.

## 7.5. Turn on propose → review → approve / deny for assets (optional)

Use this when someone has to **sign off** before a booking is real: the mechanic asking for Truck 2, the nurse requesting the meeting room, the intern reserving the loaner laptop.

### The stages

Every request moves through this state machine:

```
requested  ─approve─▶  approved  ─finalize─▶  finalized
    │                     │                        │
    │                     ├─revoke─▶  (back to requested)
    ├─deny─▶  denied                              ─revoke─▶  (back to approved)
    │
    └─(if tier 2 needed)─▶  pending_higher  ─approve/deny─▶ …
```

Plain English:

- **requested** — someone just submitted it. Shows a `Req` pill on the asset row.
- **approved** — a supervisor said yes. Shows the event with no prefix.
- **finalized** — locked in, the schedule is official. Shows a `Final` pill.
- **pending_higher** — tier-1 approved but it needs a director too.
- **denied** — rejected. Shows a `Denied` pill.

### 1. Turn on the feature

In your WorksCalendar, pass a list of categories that should go through approval, and turn on the approvals block in config:

```jsx
<WorksCalendar
  assets={assets}
  assetRequestCategories={['vehicle', 'room', 'equipment']}
  initialView="assets"
  calendarId="team-alpha"
  ownerPassword={import.meta.env.VITE_OWNER_PASSWORD}
/>
```

Then as the owner, open the config panel → **Approvals** tab and flip `enabled` on. (Same tab lets you edit everything below without writing code.)

### 2. Decide who approves what

The owner config has a `tiers` array. The defaults are two tiers:

```js
approvals: {
  enabled: true,
  tiers: [
    { id: 'tier-1', label: 'Supervisor', requires: 'any', roles: ['supervisor'] },
    { id: 'tier-2', label: 'Director',   requires: 'all', roles: ['director'] },
  ],
}
```

- `requires: 'any'` — one person on that tier is enough.
- `requires: 'all'` — every listed role must approve before it moves on.
- One-tier setup? Delete tier-2. Three-tier? Add a tier-3.

### 3. Decide what buttons appear at each stage

Each stage has an `allow` list — those are the buttons approvers see:

```js
rules: {
  requested:      { allow: ['approve', 'deny'],       prefix: 'Req' },
  pending_higher: { allow: ['approve', 'deny'],       prefix: 'Pend' },
  approved:       { allow: ['finalize', 'revoke'],    prefix: '' },
  finalized:      { allow: ['revoke'],                prefix: 'Final' },
  denied:         { allow: ['revoke'],                prefix: 'Denied' },
}
```

Remove an action to hide the button. Change a `prefix` to change what shows on the pill.

### 4. Rename the buttons (optional)

Not every team says "Approve." Use the labels map:

```js
labels: {
  approve:  'Sign off',
  deny:     'Reject',
  finalize: 'Lock in',
  revoke:   'Undo',
}
```

### 5. What your users see

**The requester (proposer):** clicks **Request Asset** on the assets tab, fills in the form, submits. Their request shows up with a `Req` pill.

**The reviewer (approver):** clicks the caret next to any pill. A popover appears with exactly the buttons you allowed for that stage. One click moves the request forward or back.

**The audit trail:** every stage change is stamped with who did it and when. Open the Audit drawer on any event to see the full history — who requested, who approved, when it was finalized.

### 6. How to persist stage changes

The calendar never mutates approval stage on its own. When a button is clicked, WorksCalendar fires `onApprovalAction(eventId, action)`. Your handler:

1. Writes the new `meta.approvalStage = { stage, updatedAt, actorId }` on the event.
2. Appends a history entry.
3. Saves via the same path as a normal edit (`onEventSave` or your adapter).

Here's a minimal handler:

```js
async function handleApprovalAction(eventId, action) {
  const event = await loadEvent(eventId);
  const nextStage = advanceStage(event.meta.approvalStage?.stage, action);
  const updated = {
    ...event,
    meta: {
      ...event.meta,
      approvalStage: { stage: nextStage, updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(), actorId: me.id },
      approvalHistory: [
        ...(event.meta.approvalHistory ?? []),
        { action, stage: nextStage, actorId: me.id, at: new Date().toISOString() },
      ],
    },
  };
  await saveEvent(updated);
}
```

### Common patterns

| You want… | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| A one-step approval (no director tier) | Keep only `tier-1`; remove `pending_higher` from `allow` lists |
| Anyone on the team can approve | Leave `roles: []` — any authenticated user counts |
| Require two supervisors | `tier-1` with `requires: 'all'` and two roles listed |
| Hide denied items from the main view | Saved view with filter `approvalStage != 'denied'` |
| Only the owner can finalize | Remove `finalize` from `approved.allow` and handle it through a custom owner action |

## 8. Pick a theme

Pick one packaged theme or roll your own with CSS.

```jsx
import 'works-calendar/styles';
import 'works-calendar/styles/ocean'; // pick one

<WorksCalendar theme="ocean" />
```

Packaged themes: `aviation`, `soft`, `minimal`, `corporate`, `forest`, `ocean`.

Want your own colors? Override the CSS variables — see any theme file in `src/themes/` for the full list.

## 9. Let outsiders book time (optional)

If customers, patients, or students need to request time without logging in, drop in the external form:

```jsx
import { CalendarExternalForm, createLocalStorageDataAdapter } from 'works-calendar';

const adapter = createLocalStorageDataAdapter({ key: 'intake' });

<CalendarExternalForm adapter={adapter} />
```

Swap the adapter for Supabase, Google, M365, or your own API — the form doesn't care.

## 10. Turn on the setup wizard (optional)

Give non-technical owners a first-time walkthrough (theme, team, categories, smart views):

```jsx
<WorksCalendar
  calendarId="team-alpha"
  ownerPassword={import.meta.env.VITE_OWNER_PASSWORD}
  events={events}
  onEventSave={handleSave}
/>
```

The wizard opens once. The owner can reopen it with the wand button.

More: [Setup wizard](./SetupWizard.md).

## 11. Ship it

The calendar is just a React component, so it deploys wherever React deploys. Fastest free paths:

- **Vercel**: `npx vercel` in your project folder.
- **Netlify**: drag the `dist/` folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop after `npm run build`.
- **GitHub Pages**: `npm run build` and push `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch.

If you're using Google or Microsoft sync, remember to add your production URL to the **Authorized origins / Redirect URIs** list in the provider guide you followed.
